# WGPU Triangle in D
You should build [wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native) and place libwgpu.so (from `target/`) in this directory.
I can't figure out how to build it without referencing to my system
I built from the commit `1a4751006bd81926ffda6b5eed06ebb23ffdcea0`, date: Thu Apr 28 06:01:12 2022 +0200
